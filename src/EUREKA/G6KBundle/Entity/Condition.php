 * This class allows the storage and retrieval of the attributes of a condition
 *
 * A condition is a part of the set of conditions that makes up a busines rule of a simulator.
 * It is a true/false (Boolean) expression that consists of one predicate that are applied to data.
 *
 * It may be the only condition of the set of condtions or combined with other conditions using connectors "all", "any" and "none".
 *
 * A condition has the following syntax :
 * <pre>
 * &lt;operand&gt;&lt;operator&gt;[&lt;arithmetic expression&gt;]
 * </pre>
 * Operand, operator and arithmetic expression are stored in instances of this class.
