/**
 *
 * This class allows the storage and retrieval of the attributes of a connector
 *
 * A connector is an object that combines conditions in a business rule of a simulator. A connector is a combined condition.
 *
 * There are three types of connectors :
 * 
 * - Connector "all": the result of the evaluation of the combined condition is true if all the conditions inside the connector are evaluated to true. This is the equivalent of Boolean "and".  
 * - Connector "any": the result of the evaluation of the combined condition is true if at least one of the conditions inside the connector is evaluated to true. This is the equivalent of Boolean "or".  
 * - Connector "not": the result of the evaluation of the combined condition is true if none of the conditions inside the connector is evaluated to true. This is the equivalent of Boolean "not".
